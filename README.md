##Settings
Environment Requirements

- python 3.6+

- Tensorflow 1.12.0+

Environmental preparation

- You can change the experimental settings in LACO/common/global_config.py

- The initial content under directory LACO/ie/src/bert is primarily from [Google bert](https://github.com/google-research/bert). Citation information is recorded in the corresponding file. You can download and unzip it at LACO/pretrained_model/ .

##Datasets
- [AAPD](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/Castor-data/tree/master/datasets/AAPD)
- [RCV1-V2](http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/jmlr/papers/volume5/lewis04a/lyrl2004_rcv1v2_README.htm)

Data Preparation

The sample data are in the directory LACO/log/re_model/input. 
Note that the "text" field stores the text content, the "spo_list" field stores the relevant labels in "predicate", and the other fields can be ignored.

##How To Run
-  Train_mltc_with_plcp:    python ie/train_main_plcp.py
-  Test_mltc_with_plcp:     python ie/test_main_plcp.py
-  Train_mltc_with_clcp:    python ie/train_main_clcp.py
-  Test_mltc_with_clcp:     python ie/test_main_clcp.py

##Results
The best model of +PLCP of AAPD dataset and and RCV1V2 dataset can be found at https://share.weiyun.com/5EXHqEPE (password: 8yrgji) for your reference.
